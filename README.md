# AoC in Java 8
This repository contains solutions I made to Advent of Code 2015-2024 with Java 8, as practice for a CS class.

I am doing AoC in Java 8 even though I don't actually know/understand all the core data structures because as you know, the best way to learn flying is sitting in the cockpit, pushing buttons and turning knobs until something interesting happens.
###### ^ NEVER quote me on this in ANY context.

This repo is WIP. Latest completed solution: **2015 Day 5 Part 1**

### Disclaimer
Outside help was used to create these solutions, primarily Oracle's documentation and occasionally ChatGPT when a search engine couldn't understand my question properly. I also used ChatGPT to debug code that was behaving wrongly due to behavior that I didn't know existed in Java 8, e.g. 2015 Day 3, Part 1 where I was unknowingly passing a reference to an array rather than an array itself.
