# AoC in Java 8
This repository contains solutions I made to Advent of Code 2015-2024 with Java 8, as practice for a CS class.

I am doing AoC in Java 8 even though I don't actually know/understand all the core data structures because as you know, the best way to learn flying is sitting in the cockpit, pushing buttons and turning knobs until something interesting happens.
######^NEVER quote me on this in ANY context.
